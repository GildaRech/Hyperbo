# Hyperbo
**Hyperbo** is an open-source python package, a mathematical package that implements arithmetical computations on hyperbola. This work in particular, focuses on research findings on lattice points on hyperbolas in relation with Fermat factorization equation.

It implements arithmetical results in relation with the Fermat factorization equation. This includes lattice points and solution computations, cardinals, group operations like addition and scalar multiplications on different algebraic structures, plots and general algebraic information and homomorphism relations.

**H** This class implements methods used in hyperbola parametrizations H_n. 
            It provides methods related to the object H_n.
            
**B** This class implements methods used in hyperbola parametrizations B_n. 
            It provides methods related to the object B_n.
